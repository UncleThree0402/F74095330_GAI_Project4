# Deep Image Prior with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) on CIFAR-10

## Overview

This project aims to compare the performance of Deep Image Prior (DIP) with and without the integration of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image reconstruction. The goal is to evaluate the impact of DDPM on image quality metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
